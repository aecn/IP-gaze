      <div id="part2b">
        <h4>Gaze was founded in 2140 by our CEO Diana Percy. With New Earth now accessible to
          everyone thanks to international government distribution, Diana saw this transition
          as an opportunity for all people to start over. New Earth was a chance for a new life,
          and it held far more potential than the real world could ever offer. From her home,
          she worked tirelessly to create the first microchip and syringe that would soon be the
          passion project our company aims to improve every single day. With these two components,
          you are able to become who you were meant to be. You get to choose how people see you.
          You get to live the life you always wanted. Because with our help, life is limitless.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h4>SYRINGES: Our syringes are very adaptable - you are able to inject as many types of microchips into yourself as you want
        using only one syringe! We are always coming out with new models monthly, so be sure to purchase the latest model
      if you want an easier injection.</h4>
      <h4>MICROCHIPS: The microchips shown above are some of our most popular, best-selling models. In addititon to these, there are many more options available
      in our stores. This is how a microchip works: Each microchip contains a special attribute. For example, the eye microchip has many varieties: blue, green, purple, white, etc.
    If you purchase the purple one and inject yourself with it, you now have purple irises.</h4>
